## Overview
This repository contains a Python script for automating data extraction and analysis from a popular payment gateway. The script utilizes Selenium for web scraping and machine learning models for data analysis.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Chrome web browser
- Chromedriver
- Required Python packages (install via ```pip install -r requirements.txt```)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/billplz-data-automation.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd billplz-data-automation
```
3. Install the Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Configure Chrome Options (Optional):
You can customize the Chrome browser settings by modifying the ```setup_chrome_options()``` function in the ```main.py script```. By default, it runs in headless mode.

2. Set Up Chromedriver:
Replace the path variable in the ```main.py``` script with the path to your Chromedriver executable.

3. Run the Script:
Execute the following command to run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```
The script will log in to your Billplz account, download data, perform analysis, and save the results.

## Configuration
```main.py```: This is the main script that orchestrates the automation process. It contains functions for web scraping, data analysis, and data processing.
## Data Analysis
The data analysis is performed using machine learning models for the prediction of occupation and gender. The trained models are defined in separate functions, ```predict_occupation()``` and ```predict_gender()```.

## Output
The script generates and stores the analyzed data in a format defined in ```analyzedata()```. You can customize this function to save the data in your desired format.
